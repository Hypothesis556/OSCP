For us, three pieces of information are vital to obtain from a scheduled task to identify possible privilege escalation vectors:
- As which user account (principal) does this task get executed?
- What triggers are specified for the task?
- What actions are executed when one or more of these triggers are met?

View scheduled tasks:
```
Get-ScheduledTask
```
OR
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```
Search for exe's
```
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | findstr /i "exe" 
```

If the task executes a binary determine if you can replace the binary with icacls

Check success:
```
net localgroup administrators
```
```
net user
```
