[[Remote Desktop Users]] or [[Remote Management Users]] are groups that allow for a user to connect to a computer remotely, if the user is not a member of these groups then another way must be found to execute commands as that user

[[Runas]] can be used to execute commands as another user as long as there is GUI access. Also we can use [[WinRM]] or [[RDP]] to access the system if the user is a member of the corresponding groups. Alternatively, if the target user has the [[Log on as a batch job]] access right, we can schedule a task to execute a program of our choice as this user. Furthermore, if the target user has an active session, we can use [[PsExec]] from [[Sysinternals]].

Using Runas:
```
runas /user:[USER] cmd
```
