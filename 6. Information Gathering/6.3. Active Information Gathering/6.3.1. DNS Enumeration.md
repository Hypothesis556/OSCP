Find IP address of website:
```
host www.[WEBSITE].com
```

We can query other records like MX or TXT records using the -t option
```
host -t mx [WEBSITE].com
```
```
host -t txt [WEBSITE].com
```

Brute forcing is a trial-and-error technique that seeks to find valid information such as directories on a web server, username and password combinations, or in this case, valid DNS records. By using a wordlist containing common hostnames, we can attempt to guess DNS records and check the response for valid hostnames.

Using dnsrecon to find additional hostnames:
```
dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -D ~/list.txt -t brt
```

Using DNSenum to find additional hostnames:
```
dnsenum megacorpone.com
```

A more granular search in Windows:
```
nslookup -type=TXT info.megacorptwo.com 192.168.50.151
```
