Unlike local account hashes which are stored in the SAM, credential information such as domain hashes are stored in the memory of the **lsass.exe** process.

Get-ComputerInfo
```

It is important to note that Credential Guard is only designed to protect non-local users. This means that we are still able to obtain NTLM hashes for the local users on this machine.
